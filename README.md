## Overview
The market crash caused by Covid-19 provided many people with the opportunity to dabble in the stock market for the first time, for better or worse. Being stuck at home, I figured it would be a good idea to invest a little of my time (and maybe money) into researching the stock market.

At the moment, this repository is split into two main sections: StockTrack, and Beta. StockTrack aims to pull data from the NZX website and write this data to files. It was designed to be run on a Raspberry Pi, where it can just tick over, collecting data. Beta is an exploration of the beta value of a stock, supposedly a measure of volatility relative to a market index benchmark.
